# Creating VITE + Storybook:

# 1: RUN npm create vite@latest
Create React App BEFORE adding Storyook!
If in a desired directory (name of the app), set "Project name" to ".", to use current DIR.
(Or use npm init vite, as in https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-for-vite/ but VITE is still the first step)

# 2: RUN npx sb init --builder @storybook/builder-vite
